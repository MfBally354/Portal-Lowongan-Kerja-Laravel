## Status
⚠️ Experimental / Incomplete Project

## Purpose
This project was created as a self-experiment to explore Laravel and Tailwind CSS.

## What went wrong
- Over-reliance on AI-generated code
- Lack of understanding of Tailwind build process
- CSS not loading properly due to missing build steps

## What I learned
- Tailwind CSS requires a build pipeline (Vite, npm)
- AI assistance is effective only when fundamentals are understood
- Simpler stack is better for beginners

## Next steps (optional)
- Rebuild without Tailwind
- Or archive this repo as a learning log
